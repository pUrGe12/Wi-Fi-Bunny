Possible ways to do this:

1. Write C and flash using ESP-IDF (boring)
2. Use ESP8266 Non-OS SDK (not-so-boring)
3. Write it in assembly and flash with ESP-IDF (fun)

Non-OS SDK provides a bunch of low-level C functions that we can
use for Wi-Fi without a string RTOS overhead.

Challenges with ESP8266
- Low memory (~50KB usable)
- Watchdog timers

ESP8266 has two watchdog timers:
1. Software watchdog
	- Resets ESP if a function runs for more than 3.2 seconds
	- Kicked using `system_soft_wdt_feed()`
2. Hardware watchdog
	- Lower-level timer, resets if no kicks for 6 seconds

To bypass watchdog resets, feed it regularly or add delays.
