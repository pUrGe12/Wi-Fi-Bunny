To build a C++ code for ESPs follow this guide

1. Create a file (say named 'test.c')
2. Create a directory called `main` and move "test_scan.c" inside
`main`.
3. Create a 'CMakeLists.txt' file inside the main directory
and save the following in that.
```
idf_component_register(SRCS "test_scan.c"
                    INCLUDE_DIRS ".")
```
4. Create a 'CMakeLists.txt' file in `../main` (from the test_scan.c
file's directory) and save the following in that.
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
project(test_scan)
```
5. Build the project by running
```
idf.py build
```
